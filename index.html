    <h3>Connect with sustainable energy</h3>
    <p>Batteries are the most commonly used energy system in our daily lives, and the ambient temperature, the number of uses and the degree of aging can seriously affect battery performance. In the promotion of sustainable energy today, lithium-ion batteries, due to their high energy density and long life, are reliable and efficient energy storage systems to balance power supply and demand. By studying the effects of temperature, number of uses and aging, we ensure the stability and efficiency of batteries in long-term use, thereby supporting sustainable energy applications and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Significance and innovation of the project</h2>
    <p>Significance：According to the survey, the use of lithium batteries is increasing year by year, but lithium batteries contain chemical components that damage the environment, and the increase in the number of waste batteries will damage the sustainability of the environment. We want to provide recommendations for increasing battery life and reducing the number of discarded batteries by analyzing the two factors most likely to affect battery performance: temperature and time. Innovation: Through matlab simulation, we respectively tested the charge and discharge data of the battery under the conditions of low temperature, room temperature and high temperature,new batteries, 300 and 1000 charge and discharge batteries, including current and voltage, SOC and battery temperature, and drew the relevant curves. The relevant conclusions are drawn by analyzing the curve data.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Approach</h2>
    <p>Connect the experimental setup as shown in Figure 1 Experimental process. The function of this model is mainly to charge and discharge the LiFeP4 battery at the set power, and monitor the SOC, output current, output voltage, battery temperature and other parameters of the battery in real time.</p>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>Matlab, Simulink</p>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>We need to study the temperature and aging’s influence, so it’s needed to set some parameters for the temperature and time. Fortunately, the batteries module has this setting inside and we can change it to do different simulations. In order to check the curve of current and voltage of the batteries, the output ports are also needed. The components are shown in detail on below:</p>
    <p>1.Voltage Input (V_bat): Set the rated voltage for Li batteries.</p>
    <p>2.Output Power (5000):Power is set in over or below 0 means it is charging or discharging, in the experiment this means Li batteries are charging with power supply or Li batteries are used for power source.</p>
    <p>3.Multipliers and Dividers (x, /):Used for calculations such as determining the power per single battery cell based on the output power, cascade, and parallel configurations.</p>
    <p>4.Mode Controllers:Control the mode based on the power value. If power (P) is larger than  zero, it directs the flow to calculate equivalent resistance. If P is less than zero, it calculates charging current.</p>
    <p>5.Equivalent Resistance Calculation:Determines the equivalent resistance based on input power and various control mechanisms (e.g., minimum and maximum resistance control).</p>
    <p>6.Minimum and Maximum Resistor Control:Ensures that the equivalent resistance stays within specified limits (0.1 and 1000 ohms) by using comparators and switches.</p>
    <p>7.Switches and Control Logic:Used to determine the charging path, depending on the charging control signal and equivalent resistance input.</p>
    <p>8.Equivalent Variable Resistor (R):Represents an adjustable resistance value based on calculations, which can be modified dynamically to control charging characteristics.</p>
    <p>9.Temperature Source:Set the working temperature.</p>
    <p>10.Battery Model:Contains battery-related state parameters such as State of Charge (SOC), current, voltage, and temperature. These values are output to monitor the battery’s condition. It can also set the initial and inner temperature and aging.</p>
    <p>11.Output Ports for Monitoring (SOC, Current, Voltage, Battery Temperature):</p>
       <p>SOC (%): Shows the battery’s state of charge as a percentage.</p>
       <p>Current (A): Displays the current flowing through the battery.</p>
       <p>Voltage (V): Indicates the voltage level of the battery.</p>
       <p>Battery Temperature (°C): Shows the current temperature of the battery cell.</p>
    <h2>Actual Tasks</h2>
    <p>The SOC, output current, output voltage, battery temperature and other parameters of the LiFeP4 battery were obtained through MATLAB simulation circuit diagram at three different temperatures of -10 25 60, and the influence of temperature on battery management was analyzed through these parameters.</p>

    <br>
    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <p>This week, we will take measurements and records to discuss the correctness of the data. Analyze and summarize the data.</p>
    <h2>Part 2 Experiment results and analysis</h2>
    <h3>1. Effect of temperature change on battery performance</h3>
    <p>Low temperature condition (2°C):</p>
    <p>(1) The SOC curve (such as Figure 1-1 and 3-1) shows that the SOC increases slowly during charging and decreases slowly during discharging, indicating that the battery's charging and discharging efficiency is significantly reduced at low temperatures. This is due to the slow chemical reaction rate of the battery under low temperature conditions.</p>
    <p>(2) The output current curve (such as Figure 1-2 and 3-2) shows that the charging and discharging output current is low under low temperature, which indicates that the battery's discharge capacity is limited at low temperatures and cannot provide high instantaneous power.</p>
    <p>(3) The output voltage curve (such as Figure 1-3 and 3-3) also shows that the battery's voltage drop is more obvious under low temperature conditions, which may be due to increased internal resistance.</p>
    <p>(4) The battery cell temperature curve (such as Figure 1-4 and 3-4) shows that the battery temperature fluctuates less under low temperature conditions and more under high temperature conditions.</p>
    <p>Summary: Low temperature will reduce the battery's charging and discharging efficiency and increase internal resistance. The BMS needs to reduce the current demand under low temperature conditions and increase the battery's operating temperature through the thermal management system to improve performance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>High temperature conditions (60°C):</p>
    <p>(1) The SOC curves (such as Figure 2-1 and 4-1) show that the SOC drops rapidly and increases faster during charging, indicating that the battery charges and discharges faster at high temperatures and that the battery has a higher discharge efficiency.</p>
    <p>(2) The output current curves (such as Figure 2-2 and 4-2) show that the battery discharge current is higher at high temperatures, which means that the battery can provide higher power output under high temperature conditions.</p>
    <p>(3) The output voltage curves (such as Figure 2-3 and 4-3) show that the voltage is relatively stable, but long-term high temperature operation may cause excessive voltage fluctuations or overheating problems.</p>
    <p>(4) The cell temperature curves (such as Figure 2-4 and 4-4) show that the battery temperature rises rapidly. Excessive temperature may cause the battery to overheat, shorten the battery life and increase safety risks.</p>
    <p>Summary: High temperature accelerates the battery charging and discharging process, but it may also cause the battery to overheat and accelerate aging. The BMS needs to monitor the temperature to prevent the battery from entering an overheating state and take cooling measures when necessary.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>2. Impact of battery aging on performance</h3>
    <p>By analyzing data at different times of use at 25°C (e.g., 300 times, 1000 times), we can see the impact of aging on battery performance:</p>
    <p>Comparison between new and aged batteries (Figure 1-1 vs Figure 2-1):</p>
    <p>(1) The SOC curve (e.g., Figure 1-1, 2-1) shows that as the number of charge and discharge cycles increases, the SOC decreases faster, indicating that the available capacity of the battery decreases.</p>
    <p>(2) The output current curve (e.g., Figure 1-2, 2-2) shows that after battery aging, the output current gradually decreases, and the aged battery cannot provide as much current as a new battery.</p>
    <p>(3) The output voltage curve (e.g., Figure 1-3, 2-3) shows that the voltage is more likely to drop during discharge, indicating that the voltage stability of the battery decreases and the internal resistance increases after aging.</p>
    <p>(4) The cell temperature curve (e.g., Figure 1-4, 2-4) shows that the temperature of the aged battery rises faster, and the thermal management of the aged battery becomes more difficult and prone to overheating.</p>
    <p>Summary: Battery aging can lead to problems such as capacity attenuation, increased internal resistance and temperature rise. BMS needs to introduce health status monitoring and dynamically adjust the charging cut-off voltage and maximum discharge current to adapt to battery aging.</p>

    <br>
    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>The impact of temperature on the battery management system</h3>
    <p>1. Battery charge and discharge efficiency: Under low temperature conditions, the chemical reaction rate of the battery slows down, resulting in a decrease in charge and discharge efficiency. On the contrary, under high temperature conditions, the battery reaction speeds up, the charge and discharge efficiency increases, but the SOC rises and falls faster, which reflects that high temperature will accelerate battery aging.</p>
    <p>2. Battery output power: Under low temperature conditions, the battery's discharge capacity is limited and cannot provide a large current. Under high temperature conditions, the battery can provide a higher output current, but it is necessary to prevent long-term high temperature operation from causing the battery to overheat.</p>
    <p>3. Voltage stability: Under low temperature conditions, the voltage is more likely to drop. Under high temperature conditions, although the battery voltage is relatively stable in the short term, long-term high temperature may cause voltage fluctuations and battery overheating.</p>
    <p>4. Temperature changes have a direct impact on the battery's discharge capacity. Low temperature has little effect on the battery's discharge capacity, but high temperature will cause the battery to run out of power faster.</p>
    <h3>The impact of time on the battery management system</h3>
    <p>1. Battery cycle life: The most obvious thing is that the soc graph can be observed that the old battery cannot be fully discharged, indicating that the battery's available capacity is reduced. This is because the battery's chemical substances are gradually exhausted and the battery's energy storage capacity is reduced.</p>
    <p>2. Battery temperature management: As the battery usage time increases, the heat generated by the aging battery during the discharge process increases, causing the battery temperature to rise.</p>
    <p>3. Battery charge and discharge efficiency: The chemical reaction activity of the battery gradually decreases, which leads to a gradual decrease in charge and discharge efficiency.ation.</p>
    <p>4. Battery output power: According to the data chart, it can be found that the output voltage and output current of the aging battery will decrease, which indicates that the discharge capacity of the old battery has decreased.</p>
    <h3>How to ensure that the performance and safety of the battery pack are optimized</h3>
    <p>1. Avoid using the battery under extreme temperature conditions: For example, in an environment with too high temperature and too low temperature, the battery status should be observed under extreme conditions to prevent overcharging and discharging.</p>
    <p>2. Battery temperature monitoring: Real-time monitoring of battery temperature to ensure that the battery operates within a safe temperature range.</p>
    <p>3. By monitoring the battery's usage cycle, load conditions and health status, the BMS can adjust the battery's operating parameters and extend the battery's service life.</p>
    <p>4. Charge and discharge protection: For aging batteries, set reasonable charge and discharge limits.</p>
    <p>5. Safety management strategy: Through comprehensive temperature, voltage, current monitoring and fault protection mechanisms, short circuits, explosions and other potential dangers can be prevented.</p>
    <h3>Future Steps</h3>
    <p>In this project, we analyzed the battery characteristics through temperature and aging, however, only some analysis was carried out on how to improve the battery performance. In the future steps, we can protect the battery life by changing the battery output and input power and adjusting the internal heat dissipation of the battery. In addition, we can also analyze other influencing conditions, such as the humidity of the environment and the battery material. So in the future, we can analyze different batteries to find the best performance battery materials.</p>
    <p>Make a PPT and website, and give the first trial lecture for the presentation.</p>
