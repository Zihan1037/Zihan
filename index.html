    <h3>Connect with sustainable energy</h3>
    <p>Batteries are the most commonly used energy system in our daily lives, and the ambient temperature, the number of uses and the degree of aging can seriously affect battery performance. In the promotion of sustainable energy today, lithium-ion batteries, due to their high energy density and long life, are reliable and efficient energy storage systems to balance power supply and demand. By studying the effects of temperature, number of uses and aging, we ensure the stability and efficiency of batteries in long-term use, thereby supporting sustainable energy applications and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Significance and innovation of the project</h2>
    <p>Significance：According to the survey, the use of lithium batteries is increasing year by year, but lithium batteries contain chemical components that damage the environment, and the increase in the number of waste batteries will damage the sustainability of the environment. We want to provide recommendations for increasing battery life and reducing the number of discarded batteries by analyzing the two factors most likely to affect battery performance: temperature and time. Innovation: Through matlab simulation, we respectively tested the charge and discharge data of the battery under the conditions of low temperature, room temperature and high temperature, including current and voltage, SOC and battery temperature, and drew the relevant curves. The relevant conclusions are drawn by analyzing the curve data.</p>
